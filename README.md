# Interview website

I have seen the O2 job interview page and decided to replicate it.

## Description

The website is meant to be run on a dekstop computer (since it's not responsive).


## Note
To update:
1. Refractor CSS
2. Add responsiveness

## How to run

I use `http-server` to run the file.

### So in **VS Code** install http-server.
`npm install http-server`

### Run
`http-server`
